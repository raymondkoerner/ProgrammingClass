    <h3>
      BARACK OBAMA WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
    </h3>
    <p>
      During his time in Harvard, in 1990, Obama became the first African American elected president of the Harvard Law Review. From January 8, 1997 to November 4, 2004, he was a member of the Illinois Senate from the 13th district. Then from January 3, 2005 to November 16, 2008, Obama served as the United States Senator from Illinois. In February 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States. In the 2008 United States presidential election, he defeated the Republican candidate John McCain winning 52.9% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes as compared to MaCain’s 173. In the 2012 elections, Obama was re-elected with 332 electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote. Thus Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States from January 20, 2009 to January 20, 2017. More importantly, Obama was the first African American to be elected president of the United States. His victory had major symbolic significance for the historically marginalized African American community in the United States.

  <h3>
    AL-QAEDA TERRORIST OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS KILLED DURING HIS PRESIDENCY
  </h3>
  <p>
    In January 2011, the CIA briefed Vice Admiral William H. McRaven about the location of Osama bin Laden, the founder and first leader of the Islamist group Al-Qaeda who played a leading role in the September 11 attacks on the United States. On March 14, 2011, President Obama met with the National Security Council to review the options. Due to his concerns that the mission would be exposed and as he wanted to proceed quickly, Obama decided against involving Pakistan, the nation in which Bin Laden was hiding. On March 29, Obama ruled out a bombing plan and authorized a “surgical raid” to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. On April 19, Obama gave provisional approval for the helicopter raid. On May 1, 2011, the operation was conducted successfully and Osama bin Laden was shot dead in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The raid was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and a large number of governments. It ended a nearly 10 year search for Bin Laden.

  <h3>
    BARACK OBAMA WON THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE IN 2009
  </h3>
  <p>
    Barack Obama’s 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father is regarded as one of the best memoirs ever written by an American politician. In 2006, its abridged audio-book version won the Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album. The following year, the memoir also received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Nonfiction. In 2009, President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”. He was the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. In 2013, Obama received the Israeli President’s Medal of Distinction, the highest civil medal given by the State of Israel. In 2017, Obama was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest award that is presented by the Secretary of Defense. The same year, he also received the Profile in Courage Award presented by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
